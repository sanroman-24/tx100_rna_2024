# Tracking non-genetic evolution from primary to metastatic ccRCC: TRACERx Renal 100

## Structure and content of this repository

This repository works contains all the code and data necessariy to reproduce the results, figures (main and supplementary) and tables of the manuscript "*Tracking non-genetic evolution from primary to metastatic ccRCC: TRACERx Renal*".

Running the scripts in [analysis/scripts](https://github.com/sanroman-24/tx100_rna_2024/tree/main/analysis/scripts) reproduces all the analyses in the manuscript, with the exception of single-cell RNA-Seq results, for which data availability is controlled by corresponding authors. Auxiliar functions are located in [src](https://github.com/sanroman-24/tx100_rna_2024/tree/main/src). Scripts are sequentially numbered in the order we recommend running. We nevertheless provide below an index of what scripts reproduce the different figures and tables in the manuscript.
